## C&C Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert Map Editor

An enhanced version of the C&C Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert Map Editor based on the source code released by Electronic Arts.
The goal of the project is simply to improve the usability and convenience of the map editor, fix bugs, improve and clean its code-base,
enhance compatibility with different kinds of systems and enhance the editor's support for mods.

Once the project has proceeded far enough and I am pleased with the state of the editor, I might also look into making it support Tiberian Sun.

### Current features

* Downsized menu graphics by an user-configurable factor so you can see more placeable object types at once on sub-4K monitors
* Improved zoom levels
* Fixed a couple of crashes

This list will be kept up-to-date as more features are added.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the scope of the project. If there's a bug that you'd like to fix or functionality that you'd like to enhance, feel free to make an issue for discussing it or a pull request if you'd want to push code.

### Contact

You can find me and discuss features on the Assembly Armada's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UnWK2Tw). Note that this project is not officially affiliated with [The Assembly Armada](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada), but their server has become a general hub for discussing the released C&C source code so and C&C reverse-engineering efforts, which is a fitting context for this map editor.
